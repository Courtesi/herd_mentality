So it looks like our plan is to let the frontend manage the displayment of the position changes, right? It tacks on the new trades it receives from our SSE while possibly deleting old ones. I guess we don't need to track our positions. Let's just track new trades so buys/sells are both displayed even if our position is "no longer there", so to speak. We can be less aggressive with the polling, say every 2-5 seconds.

the bot_online_flag will not be reset every iteration as we are in a self.polling while loop. That while loop will continue running until we stop polling. It only prints if the bot is online/offline once it detects it one time. Can we just have two modes for the bot? Online/offline? No need to check it's starting/running/stopped status. Let's normalize our states. Online/offline please. Sure, let's move the bot_online_flag variable if it matters to you. Let's shrink status detection to just online/offline. Reflect these changes in the bot as well.


Can we first get 100 active events and can we choose an event that will not end before the poll ends? So we can use min_close_ts as a parameter to tell Kalshi to filter for events that won't close for a week, about 4 days after the poll ends. Many of the times there will be more than 2 markets, that means there is multiple candidates for a winner. In this case, we should only be picking the yes_ask to pay. If there is only one market, then that means it's most likely a yes/no answer. So in this case, we can be binary. I want to take out the randomization of the questions and base our poll type off of the event that we randomly choose. Also, for the amount polls, our options should be randomized as counts instead of dollar amounts. So for now, from 1-5. This was not as well put together as I wanted but I need you to ask questions about requirements until you are 99% sure. Lots of changes have been made.[I
